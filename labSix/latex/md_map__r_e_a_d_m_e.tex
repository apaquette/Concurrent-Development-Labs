Map is the simplest pattern. It is embarrisingly parallel with no need for any data sharing between threads.

Two examples are included here with code showing how to get timing results demonstrating speedup.\hypertarget{md_map__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{SAXPY}\label{md_map__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
This is a standard algorithm used a lot in simulation. It stands for Single-\/precision y \+:= alpha $\ast$ x + y where alpha is a scalar and x and y are n-\/vectors. SAXPY is a combination of scalar multiplication and vector addition, and itâ€™s very simple\+: it takes as input two vectors of 32-\/bit floats X and Y with N elements each, and a scalar value A. It multiplies each element X\mbox{[}i\mbox{]} by A and adds the result to Y\mbox{[}i\mbox{]}. There are Double and Complex data type versions as well -\/ DAxpy, Caxpy, Zaxpy.\hypertarget{md_map__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Mandelbroit Set}\label{md_map__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The Mandelbrot set is a two-\/dimensional set with a relatively simple definition that exhibits great complexity, especially as it is magnified. It is popular for its aesthetic appeal and fractal structures. The set is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers c c for which the function f\+\_\+\{c\}(z)=z$^\wedge$\{2\}+c does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at z = 0 z=0, i.\+e., for which the sequence f\+\_\+\{c\}(0)\}, f\+\_\+\{c\}(f\+\_\+\{c\}(0))\}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

This set was first defined and drawn by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978, as part of a study of Kleinian groups.\mbox{[}3\mbox{]} Afterwards, in 1980, Benoit Mandelbrot obtained high-\/quality visualizations of the set while working at IBM\textquotesingle{}s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set}{\texttt{ label}}
